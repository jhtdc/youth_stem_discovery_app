User Stories for the youth of color stem program discovery app. 

The primary purpose of this app/ website is to give students of color interested in STEM an opportunity to learn about internships, careers and training opportunities in tech and the sciences. We want to inspire students while giving them the tools to learn more about enrichment opportunities in their respective geographic regions.
