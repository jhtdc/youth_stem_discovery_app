User Stories for the youth of color stem program discovery app. 

The primary purpose of this app/ website is to give students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds an opportunity to learn about internships, careers and training opportunities in tech, entrepreneurship and the sciences. We want to inspire students while giving them the tools to learn more about enrichment opportunities in their respective geographic regions.

(1) As a high school student with an interest in robotics, I'd like to watch interviews of young professionals in the field so that I can be inspired by their stories.

(2) As the outreach coordinator at a program teaching black and latino kids to code, I want to find new ways to reach more students, so that we can continue to scale our impact in the communities that we serve.

(3) As a parent, I want to find a local and age appropriate STEM enrichment program for my child, so that (s)he can continue nurturing an interest in robotics.

(4) As a tech employee interested in promoting diversity in tech, I want to find local opportunities to help, so that I can use my talent & access to impact students in my city.

(5) As a high school science teacher, I want to find inspiring content and extracurricular programs that will help me to expose my students to the tech industry.

(6) As a black high school student with an interest in tech, I want to find a code camp this summer, so that I can learn cool stuff while having fun.
