User Stories for the youth of color stem program discovery app. 

The primary purpose of this app/ website is to give students of color interested in STEM an opportunity to learn about internships, careers and training opportunities in tech and the sciences. We want to inspire students while giving them the tools to learn more about enrichment opportunities in their respective geographic regions.

(1) As a high school student, I want to see/hear first hand interviews from young tech professionals that look like me, so that I can be inspired to pursue my interest in STEM.

(2) As a parent, I want to find a local and age appropriate STEM code camp or after school program for my child, so that (s)he can continue nurturing an interest in robotics.

(3) As a tech employee interested in promoting diversity in tech, I want to find local opportunities to help, so that I can use my talent & access to impact students in my city.

(4) As the director of a youth stem program, I want to find a way to reach more interested students & parents, so that we can scale our efforts and serve more interested students.
